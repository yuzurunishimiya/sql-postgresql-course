Challanges of Postgres:
    - writing efficient queries to retriev information
    - designing the schema, or structur of the database
    - understanding when to use advance features
    - managing the database in a production environment



Database Design Process:
    1. What kind of thing are we storing?
    2. What properties does this thing have?
    3. what type of data does each of those properties contain?

    Possible answer:
    1. We should create a table ...
    2. The table should have columns ..., ..., ..., etc
    3. Each column should indicate the type of data that it is going to store
